  Title: Rather Be Dead
<br>
     It is a "chaos" of collage. First figure is 'Hurtle' which has horse head but
turtle's body. 
<br>
A horse is fast and a turtle is slow. A horse lives for the race, but turtle lives for the travel. <br>
It sounds better to enjoy the journey of our lives than to have a race with other
competitors. 
<br>
<br>
But this modern society makes overly competitive society.
<br>
People are suffering from choosing between the race and journey in our lives. It is difficult to enjoy the view during the race, because if you do, you will lose. 
<br>
But, if you choose to just enjoy the journey,you will get behind. <br>
<br>

This confusing figure, Hurtle is reflecting myself who got confused with
all the racings and journeys that I am going through. <br>

<br>
However, the person saw Hurtle, and this
person felt the same with Hurtle and helpless with himself or herself situation which is anxiety and confusion. <br>
<br>

Therefore, he or she decided to do kill himself or herself to escape the
confusion, but TreeMax, which is combination between tree object and BayMax object, tried to stop him. <br>
But this person felt so helpless and overwhelmed by seeing TreeMax too because
there is not even a tree in this space but robots.
<br>
Then, this person says, "I rather be dead."
